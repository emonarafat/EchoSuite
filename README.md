# Voice-Driven ERP System for Showroom Management

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development of a Voice-Driven ERP System designed for showroom operations. The system will allow showroom employees to manage customers, generate invoices, and update financial records using voice commands.

The system will be built using C# (.NET Core), SQL Server, and React Native. Speech recognition will be powered by Azure Speech API or Google Speech-to-Text, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) will be used to extract key information from commands.

## 2. Objectives

- Automate invoice generation using voice commands.
- Improve customer management with a centralized database.
- Enhance financial tracking by integrating cash flow and customer ledger updates.
- Enable multi-platform accessibility through a React Native mobile app.
- Increase efficiency and reduce manual data entry.
- Enhance user experience with intuitive voice interactions.

## 3. Key Features & Functionalities

### A. Voice Command Processing

Employees can say:
"ERP, find customer with phone 01754031344. The customer will buy AFL-SOF-103, a 2-seater made of Mahogany lacquer, light finish, with a 10% discount."

The system will recognize, extract, and process the command.

### B. Customer Management

- Find existing customers by phone number.
- Register new customers if not found.
- Store customer details (name, phone, email, address, purchase history).
- Track customer interactions and preferences.

### C. Product & Inventory Management

- Maintain product catalog with details like material, finish, price, and stock.
- Auto-update stock levels after purchase.
- Track inventory levels and generate alerts for low stock.
- Manage supplier information and purchase orders.

### D. Invoice Generation & Discount Handling

- Auto-generate detailed invoices based on voice commands.
- Apply discounts dynamically.
- Store invoices in a structured database.
- Generate and email invoices to customers automatically.
- Support multiple payment methods (credit card, bank transfer, etc.).

### E. Cash Flow & Customer Ledger Update

- Update company cash flow after payments.
- Maintain customer ledger for financial tracking.
- Generate financial reports and summaries.

## 4. System Architecture

### A. Technology Stack

- C# (.NET Core)
- SQL Server
- React Native
- Azure Speech API or Google Speech-to-Text

### B. System Workflow

1. Employee speaks command → ERP converts speech to text.
2. NLP extracts customer, product, discount details.
3. ERP fetches customer & product details from database.
4. Invoice is generated and displayed for confirmation.
5. Payment is recorded, updating cash flow & customer ledger.

## 5. Database Design (SQL Server)

### Customers Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNumber NVARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Email NVARCHAR(100),
    Address NVARCHAR(255),
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

### Products Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductCode NVARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Name NVARCHAR(255),
    Material NVARCHAR(100),
    Finish NVARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(18,2),
    Stock INT,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

### Invoices Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Invoices (
    InvoiceID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(18,2),
    Discount DECIMAL(5,2),
    FinalAmount DECIMAL(18,2),
    Status NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

### CashFlow Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE CashFlow (
    TransactionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    InvoiceID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Invoices(InvoiceID),
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2),
    TransactionDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

## 6. API Design (ASP.NET Core C#)

### Find Customer API

```csharp
[HttpGet("customers/find")]
public IActionResult GetCustomerByPhone(string phone)
{
    var customer = _context.Customers.FirstOrDefault(c => c.PhoneNumber == phone);
    if (customer == null)
        return NotFound("Customer not found");
    return Ok(customer);
}
```

### Generate Invoice API

```csharp
[HttpPost("invoices/generate")]
public IActionResult GenerateInvoice([FromBody] InvoiceRequest request)
{
    var customer = _context.Customers.FirstOrDefault(c => c.PhoneNumber == request.PhoneNumber);
    if (customer == null) return NotFound("Customer not found");

    var product = _context.Products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.ProductCode == request.ProductCode);
    if (product == null) return NotFound("Product not found");

    decimal discountAmount = (product.Price * request.Discount) / 100;
    decimal finalPrice = product.Price - discountAmount;

    Invoice newInvoice = new Invoice
    {
        CustomerID = customer.CustomerID,
        TotalAmount = product.Price,
        Discount = request.Discount,
        FinalAmount = finalPrice
    };

    _context.Invoices.Add(newInvoice);
    _context.SaveChanges();

    return Ok(newInvoice);
}
```
